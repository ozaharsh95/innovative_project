# Analysis of confused studentâ€™s EEG waves using ANN

We collected EEG signal data from ten college students to create online education videos that are not misunderstood for university students. We made 20 videos, ten in each category, and cut the two-minute clip in the middle of a topic to make them more confusing.We categorized the data and removed the null data for better optimization of the model by selecting proper features after calculation of mi score.We define the training and testing sets to build the model. In the end we observe the accuracy.
