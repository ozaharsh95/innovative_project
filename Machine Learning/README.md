# Analysis of confused studentâ€™s EEG waves using ANN

The dataset is made by collected EEG signal data from ten college students to create online education
videos that are not misunderstood for university students. There were 20 videos, ten in each category,
and cutting the two-minute clip in the middle of a topic to make them more confusing. We categorized
the data and removed the null data from the dataset for better optimization of the model by selecting
proper features after calculation of mi score. We define the training and testing sets to build the model.
In the end we observe the accuracy and got 0.94.
